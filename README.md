Skin Cancer Binary Classification Using Computer Vision 

Dataset is from kaggle <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign'>Skin Cancer Database</a>
I had divided the Dataset to Train, Validation & Test set of my own for better accuracy and make my CNN model robost with upcoming training set, so that it can actually classify wheather the patient skin is infectted from canser or not without any false prediction.
